## The data <a name="data"></a>

### minilibx
The minilibx library. It helps me with the graphics. It contains:
- source code in C to create the mlx library
- man pages (in man/ directory)
- a test program (in test/ directory) is built with the library
- a public include file mlx.h
- a tiny configure script to generate an appropriate Makefile.gen

Requirements for macOS
```bash
~ Brew install Xquartz
~ reboot
~ xeyes # run an hello world X11 app
```

MlX Color Opacity / Transparency / Alpha (32 bits depth)

- 0xFF (fully transparent) or 0x00 (fully opaque)

Compile MinilibX

- run ./configure or make both will make a few tests, create Makefile.gen and then automatically run make on this generated Makefile.gen . libmlx.a and libmlx_$(HOSTTYPE).a are created. test/mlx-test binary is also created.

Install MinilibX

- no installation script is provided. You may want to install
	- libmlx.a and/or libmlx_$(HOSTTYPE).a in /usr/X11/lib or /usr/local/lib
	- mlx.h in /usr/X11/include or /usr/local/include
	- man/man3/mlx*.1 in /usr/X11/man/man3 or /usr/local/man/man3

### itch.io
It's an open marketplace for independent digital creators with a focus on independent video games. For this project it will help e find quality sprites for my game.

<details>
<summary>Common Instructions</summary>

- Your project must be written in C.
- Your project must be written in accordance with the Norm. If you have bonus
files/functions, they are included in the norm check and you will receive a 0 if there
is a norm error inside.
- Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double
free, etc) apart from undefined behaviors. If this happens, your project will be
considered non functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.
- All heap allocated memory space must be properly freed when necessary. No leaks
will be tolerated.
- If the subject requires it, you must submit a Makefile which will compile your
source files to the required output with the flags -Wall, -Wextra and -Werror, use
cc, and your Makefile must not relink.
- Your Makefile must at least contain the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and
re.
- To turn in bonuses to your project, you must include a rule bonus to your Makefile,
which will add all the various headers, librairies or functions that are forbidden on
the main part of the project. Bonuses must be in a different file _bonus.{c/h} if
the subject does not specify anything else. Mandatory and bonus part evaluation
is done separately.
- If your project allows you to use your libft, you must copy its sources and its
associated Makefile in a libft folder with its associated Makefile. Your project‚Äôs
Makefile must compile the library by using its Makefile, then compile the project.
- We encourage you to create test programs for your project even though this work
won‚Äôt have to be submitted and won‚Äôt be graded. It will give you a chance
to easily test your work and your peers‚Äô work. You will find those tests especially
useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use your tests
and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.
- Submit your work to your assigned git repository. Only the work in the git reposi-
tory will be graded. If Deepthought is assigned to grade your work, it will be done after 
your peer-evaluations. If an error happens in any section of your work during
Deepthought‚Äôs grading, the evaluation will stop.
</details>

### Mandatory

| **Description**  | You must create a basic 2D game in which a dolphin escapes Earth after eating some fish. Instead of a dolphin, fish, and the Earth, you can use any character, any collectible and any place you want.|
|---|---|
| **Function name**   | so_long  |
| **Files to turn in**  |  Makefile, *.h, *.c, maps |
| **Makefile** | NAME, all, clean, fclean, re |
| **Arguments** | A map in format *.ber |
| **External functions** | open, close, read, write,malloc, free, perror,strerror, exit -- All functions of the math library (-lm compiler option,man man 3 math) -- All functions of the [MiniLibX](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) -- ft_printf and any equivalent YOU coded|
| **Libft authorized** | Yes |

Your project must comply with the following rules:
- You must use the [MiniLibX](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux). Either the version available on the school machines,
or installing it using its sources.
- You have to turn in a Makefile which will compile your source files. It must not
relink.
- Your program has to take as parameter a map description file ending with the .ber
extension.

### Game
- The player‚Äôs goal is to collect every collectible present on the map, then escape
chosing the shortest possible route.
- The W, A, S, and D keys must be used to move the main character.
- The player should be able to move in these 4 directions: up, down, left, right.
- The player should not be able to move into walls.
- At every move, the current number of movements must be displayed in the shell.
- You have to use a 2D view (top-down or profile).
- The game doesn‚Äôt have to be real time.
- Although the given examples show a dolphin theme, you can create the world you
want.
### Graphic Management
- Your program has to display the image in a window.
- The management of your window must remain smooth (changing to another win-
dow, minimizing, and so forth).
- Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
- Clicking on the cross on the window‚Äôs frame must close the window and quit the
program in a clean way.
- The use of the images of the MiniLibX is mandatory.
### Map

- The map has to be constructed with 3 components: walls, collectibles, and free
space.
- The map can be composed of only these 5 characters:
	- 0 for an empty space,
	- 1 for a wall,
	- C for a collectible,
	- E for a map exit,
	- P for the player‚Äôs starting position.

Here is a simple valid map:

```bash
1111111111111
10010000000C1
1000011111001
1P0011E000001
1111111111111
```
- The map must contain at least 1 exit, 1 collectible, and 1 starting position.

> üí°  If the map contains a duplicates characters (exit/start), you should display an error message.


- The map must be rectangular.
- The map must be closed/surrounded by walls. If it‚Äôs not, the program must return
an error.
- You have to check if there‚Äôs a valid path in the map.
- You must be able to parse any kind of map, as long as it respects the above rules.
- Another example of a minimal .ber map:

```
1111111111111111111111111111111111
1E0000000000000C00000C000000000001
1010010100100000101001000000010101
1010010010101010001001000000010101
1P0000000C00C0000000000000000000C1
1111111111111111111111111111111111
```
- If any misconfiguration of any kind is encountered in the file, the program must
exit in a clean way, and return "Error\n" followed by an explicit error message of
your choice.

### Bonus (only evaluated if mandatory part is perfect)
You are allowed to use other functions to complete the bonus part as long as their
use is justified during your evaluation. Be smart!

You will get extra points if you:
- Make the player lose when they touch an enemy patrol.
- Add some sprite animation.
- Display the movement count directly on screen instead of writing it in the shell.
